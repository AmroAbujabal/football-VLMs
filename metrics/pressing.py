metrics/pressing.py

Computes all press-related advanced metrics per player:
- Press Trigger Timing  (did they press on the right cue?)
- Press Success Rate     (did the press force a turnover within N seconds?)
- PPDA per player        (passes allowed per defensive action)
- Recovery Shadow        (correct angle after losing possession)
