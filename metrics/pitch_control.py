"""
metrics/pitch_control.py

Computes frame-level pitch control for each player.
Based on the Spearman (2018) / Friends of Tracking model:
each player "controls" the zones they can reach before any opponent.

Output: a probability surface (grid) showing what fraction of the pitch
each team controls, plus per-player contribution scores.
